I am a current **Ph.D. student at Cornell University** in the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam). In 2023, I graduated from Northwestern University with a Bachelor and Master of Science in Applied Mathematics and Bachelor of Viola Performance. During my time at Northwestern, I conducted research with [Professor Melville Ulmer](https://physics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core-faculty/melville-ulmer.html) from the Department of Physics and Astronomy on a variety of projects from transient phenomena  and exoplanet detection to measuring surface roughness of telescopes.

My current research interests are in machine learning and inverse problems. The project I am working on now involves solving PDE inverse problems through the use of Neural Networks.

In my free time, I like learning new languages, traveling, and playing my viola which you can see in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFvHpRq2CeAYqGrJvhR-iA).
